## My Goal

To learn more about Optionals, solidify your understanding of the MVC design pattern and to introduce the concept of Classes. Weâ€™ll compare objects created from classes with instances of Structs that we learnt about earlier.

## What I will learn

- How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
- Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
- How to create classes and difference between classes and structs.
- Pass by value vs. pass by reference.
- Formatting Strings.
- Color literals.
